# MIT-6.8210-Underactuated-Robotics
This repository contains my implementations, notes, and exercises from the MIT 6.8210: Underactuated Robotics course. The repository includes:
--Code implementations of key algorithms for underactuated robotic systems
--Mathematical derivations of dynamics, control strategies, and trajectory optimization
--Simulations and visualizations of underactuated systems using MATLAB/Python
--Summarized lecture notes for key concepts covered in the course
This work is based on the Underactuated Robotics course by Prof. Russ Tedrake at MIT. My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of nonlinear control, model-based planning, and optimization techniques for robotics.
